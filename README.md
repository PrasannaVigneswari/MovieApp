here are some of the libraries and dependencies used in your project:

- React.js: I am using React as the main JavaScript library for building the user interface.

- React Router: I've included React Router for handling client-side routing, allowing users to navigate between different parts of your application.

- Axios: Axios is used for making HTTP requests, and it appears that I am using it to fetch data from The Movie Database (TMDb) API.

- FontAwesome: FontAwesome is used for displaying icons in your application, such as the star icon and YouTube icon.

- React Loading Skeleton: I used the react-loading-skeleton library for showing loading skeletons to improve the user experience while data is being fetched.

- React Responsive Carousel: I am using the react-responsive-carousel library to implement the carousel for displaying popular movies.



The Movie Database (TMDb) for providing the API.
